# Experience System

XP earned from actions, levels grant booster card choices.

## XP Sources

All actions grant experience:
- Gathering resources
- Defeating enemies
- Unlocking hexes
- Completing dungeons

## Level Progression

| Level | XP Required | Card Gain Rate |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| 0-6 | Lower | Faster |
| 7-9 | Higher | Slower |

Levels cycle 0-9 repeatedly.

## Level Up Flow

1. XP bar fills
2. Level increases
3. 3 random booster cards offered
4. Player selects one
5. Card activates immediately

## XP Scaling

Later worlds grant more XP per action to match increased time investment.
